# Elevator Shaft

## Summary

#### This project is a website built to practice my newly-learned full-stack development skills. With a passion for snowboarding and having a history of logging my snowboarding sessions on a generic notes app, I've decided to create this website as a custom way to log my data in a more organized and user-friendly way.
